# Simplify Fractions
## Daily Programming Challenge #2 

A fraction exists of a numerator (top part) and a denominator (bottom part) as you probably all know.
Simplifying (or reducing) fractions means to make the fraction as simple as possible. Meaning that the denominator is a close to 1 as possible. This can be done by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor.
